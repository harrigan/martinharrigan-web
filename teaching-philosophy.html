	   <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

           <h2>Introduction</h2>

           <p>
             The subject area of my teaching is software development.
             I have taught classes of students at third-level at SETU
             Waterford and SETU Carlow; I have guided individual
             students at a Teaching &amp; Learning Centre at SETU
             Waterford and I have participated in volunteer-led
             programmes such
             as <a href="https://coderdojo.com">CoderDojo</a>.  I have
             also published research into the design of integrated
             learning systems <a href="#bib1">[Harrigan et al. 2009,
             Harrigan & Wade 2009]</a>.  However, I feel a greater
             degree of uncertainty in my competencies as a teacher
             than as an expert in my subject area.  Therefore, as a
             teacher, I try to start from a position of knowledge:
             Software development is a craft and its practitioners are
             craftspeople
             <a href="#bib2">[Reeves 1992, Hunt & Thomas 1999, McBreen
               2001]</a>.  They use specialised tools to produce products
             that attain some goal in some environment.  They take
             pride in their work and view the process as a reward in
             itself.  In this context, learning is a journey from
             apprentice to craftsperson, and perhaps, to master.
             Teaching is that which creates “a stimulating and
             pervasive craft spirit” <a href="#bib3">[Bagley 2012]</a>.
           </p>

           <p>
             This key belief, that software development is a craft and
             learners wish to become craftspeople, guides me in my
             teaching and helps me to structure my teaching
             philosophy.  In the following sections, whose structure
             is adapted from Chism <a href="#bib4">[Chism 1998]</a>
             and Nilson <a href="#bib5">[Nilson 2010, pg. 321]</a>, I
             will discuss my assumptions about teaching and learning
             that underlie this philosophy, the goals it sets for my
             students, what it implies for my classroom, and my plans
             for future development.
           </p>

           <h2>Teaching & Learning</h2>

           <p>
             If learning is a journey from apprentice to
             crafts-person, then it is a journey with many ups and
             downs.  Learners are rewarded through new experiences,
             observable progress, fruitful teamwork, and reaching
             one's destination.  Indeed, “one's destination is never a
             place, but rather a new way of looking at things”
             <a href="#bib6">[Miller 1957]</a>.  However, learners may
             also experience stagnation, frustration, wrong-turns and
             detours, and a failure to reach one's destination.  In
             hindsight some of these difficulties may be beneficial.
             Learning requires perseverance and the ability to
             tolerate frustration <a href="#bib7">[Wilde 2012]</a>.
             Detours can be worthwhile and failures can be productive
             <a href="#bib8">[Kapur 2008]</a>.  Even failing to reach
             one's destination can be a good outcome; the learner may
             be able to identify a preferred destination.
           </p>

           <p>
             As a teacher, I am a guide and a motivator for some part
             of the learner's journey.  Having travelled my own path,
             not necessarily an identical one to theirs, I can assure
             them of its value.  I can identify suitable way-points.
             The learners may not be able to reach the way-points on
             their own but they can with assistance from fellow
             learners and myself <a href="#bib9">[Wass & Golding
             2014]</a>.  I provide examples of good planning.  I
             encourage the learners to reflect on their progress.  I
             emphasise the positive experiences and ameliorate the
             bad.  However, it is important to note that the learners
             are making the journeys for themselves.
           </p>

           <h2>Implementation of the Philosophy</h2>

           <p>
             In practice, teaching involves trade-offs.  I can only
             make a journey as enjoyable as possible subject to
             constraints such as timetables and the physical location
             of classrooms.
           </p>

           <p>
             As a motivator I seek motivational triggers.  Sennett
             <a href="#bib10">[Sennett 2008]</a> argues that
             motivation “is more important than talent in consummating
             craftsmanship”.  It is insufficient to simply state the
             importance of the subject matter, or claim it to be a
             required prerequisite for some future content.  While
             both these claims may be true, they do not create an
             immediate and selfish desire to engage with the content.
             In a computer programming module I introduced students to
             malware.  In order to better motivate the topic, I
             examined a popular news story at the time:  Lenovo was
             installing adware on new
             <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers">computers</a>. The
             adware was created by Superfish and Komodia and injected
             advertisements into secure connections by performing
             man-in-the-middle attacks.  The story was difficult to
             follow due to the technical details.  I used this piece
             of malware as a case study and explained in detail how it
             functioned and why it was unacceptable for Lenovo to
             install this software on new computers.  The students
             were motivated by a desire to understand the story but
             also to protect themselves.  Some were owners of Lenovo
             laptops.
           </p>

           <p>
             As a guide, I organize lesson plans and assessments that
             encourage continuous engagement.  Best practices such as
             those described by Nilson
             <a href="#bib5">[Nilson 2010, pg. 273 and pg. 281]</a>
             help structure formative and summative assessments.  In
             particular, formative assessment encourages students to
             engage in a low-stakes environment.  In a computer
             security module I introduced a game called ‘Elevation of
             Privilege’
             <a href="#bib11">[Microsoft 2020]</a> to help the
             students familiarize themselves with the process of
             threat modelling.  The game is a simple card game that
             requires students to examine a data flow diagram through
             a number of different lenses: spoofing, tampering,
             repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service
             and elevation of privilege.  By considering each of these
             in turn, the student can discover for themselves possible
             vulnerabilities in the data flow diagram.
           </p>

           <h2>Future Development</h2>

           <p>
             Craftsmanship requires practice.  However, not all
             practice makes perfect.  Sedano <a href="#bib12">[Sedano
             2012]</a> describes deliberate practice to help a learner
             improve their craft.  This includes some novel steps that
             should work well in the classroom.  I intend to
             experiment with this and similar approaches.
           </p>

           <h2>Conclusion</h2>

           <p>
             Initially I was sceptical as to the merits of a teaching
             philosophy.  Haggerty <a href="#bib13">[Haggerty
             2010]</a> argues that many contain “abstract appeals to
             unobjectionable ambitions”.  However, after writing this
             I have had a change of mind.  This exercise provided me
             with an opportunity to reflect on my profession and my
             strategies in the classroom.  If my teaching philosophy
             is drab and predictable then what does that say about my
             teaching? I am not satisfied with its current state but I
             believe that is the point: I hope the next version will
             improve upon it.
